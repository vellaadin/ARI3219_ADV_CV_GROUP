The dataset includes 845 images.
Garbage are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -12 and +12 percent
